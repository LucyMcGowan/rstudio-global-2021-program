# Bringing the Tidyverse to Python with Siuba

Last January I left my job to spend a year developing siuba, a python port of dplyr. At its core, this decision was driven by spending the last decade watching python and R users produce similar analyses, but in very different ways. In this talk, I'll discuss how siuba allows R users to transfer their hard-earned programming knowledge to python. Looking back, I'll consider two critical pieces that have helped me track progress with siuba: using it to livecode TidyTuesday analyses, and teaching it to absolute beginners.
